**Phalanx**
- eventually, fix the complexity of animations for shooting and sound stuff
- test "query.facing_target_to_range_attack" vs "query.has_target"
- might need to reduce air defense range
- ground sentry mode: figure out how reduce collateral damage (i.e. villagers)


**bofo**
- reduce complexity of animations and shooting/reloading
- test out the current changes

**Wither blocks projectiles when at half health, or at least ones identified as arrows**
- maybe phalanx responds differently to withers?

**USS Missouri ship**
- Simplify everything. It's unreasonably complex.
- consider trying to combine bb63 controller and uss missouri entities into one
  - consolidate movement controlls and weapons..?
  - idk if possible since it's look to shoot
