For the development, updating, and enhancement of the original addon, "USS Missouri Addon Minecraft PE" by Asian Rine 124

## What works
#### Phalanx Turret
- Craftable in survival. Find in crafting table.
- **Default targeting mode (130 block range)**
    - Phantoms
    - Ender Dragon
    - Wither
    - Blazes
- **Ground targeting mode (40 block range)**
    - **_Use a block of dirt to interact with the Phalanx to swap its targeting mode._**
    - Ground monsters except Endermen
    - _Watch for crossfire/friendly fire accidents lol._
 - **Arm/Disarm**
     - Hold a **Lever** in your hand and click/interact with the Phalanx turret.
- **It will defend itself when it is hit by an entity.**


#### Bofor turret
- sorta, but only obtainable in creative for now.

## What doesn't work
- Everything else pretty much.

## Resource Pack Low vs High:
- **Differences noted between subpacks "low" and "high":**
    - Particle effects are reduced or removed in "low"
    - images are more high res in "high"
